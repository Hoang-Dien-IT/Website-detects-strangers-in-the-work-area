# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the SafeFace dashboard from displaying static/hardcoded data to showing real-time analytics and statistics based on actual detection data from the face recognition system. The dashboard will provide meaningful insights about detection patterns, camera activity, and system performance using data from the existing detection tracking and optimization services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to see real-time detection statistics on the dashboard, so that I can monitor current system activity and identify trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current detection counts for the last 24 hours
2. WHEN new detections occur THEN the dashboard SHALL update statistics in real-time via WebSocket connections
3. WHEN viewing detection statistics THEN the system SHALL show separate counts for known persons and strangers
4. WHEN displaying detection data THEN the system SHALL show data from the last 7 days, 30 days, and custom date ranges

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to view camera-specific analytics, so that I can understand which cameras are most active and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing camera analytics THEN the system SHALL display detection counts per camera for the selected time period
2. WHEN a camera has no recent activity THEN the system SHALL highlight inactive cameras with visual indicators
3. WHEN viewing camera data THEN the system SHALL show average detection confidence scores per camera
4. WHEN displaying camera statistics THEN the system SHALL include session duration averages and peak activity times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to see detection trends over time, so that I can identify patterns and plan security measures accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing trend charts THEN the system SHALL display detection counts over time using line or bar charts
2. WHEN selecting different time periods THEN the system SHALL update charts to show hourly, daily, or weekly aggregations
3. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL separate known person detections from stranger detections
4. WHEN displaying trend data THEN the system SHALL highlight peak detection periods and unusual activity spikes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to see system performance metrics, so that I can ensure the face recognition system is operating efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing performance metrics THEN the system SHALL display average detection confidence scores
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL show detection processing times and success rates
3. WHEN viewing performance data THEN the system SHALL display database optimization statistics from the Detection Optimizer Service
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL highlight performance issues with visual warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to export analytics data, so that I can create reports and share insights with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting data export THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and JSON export options
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all visible chart data and statistics
3. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL respect the currently selected date range and filters
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download link or automatically download the file

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to filter and customize dashboard views, so that I can focus on specific cameras, time periods, or detection types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update all charts and statistics to reflect the selected criteria
2. WHEN filtering by camera THEN the system SHALL allow single or multiple camera selection
3. WHEN filtering by detection type THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by known persons, strangers, or both
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL persist filter settings in the user session
